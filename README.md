A vivarium with 3 species : Robots, Human and Giant Bees

This program was developped by Belkacem LAHOUEL, Luc CADORET and Valentin LE MORVAN and is a project for the course LO43 : "basics of Object-Oriented Programming"
I appologize in advance for the weird commits and the presence of some french parts. If you want to be part of the project, look at the "TODO" file in the "data" folder.
If you want to try this program, don't forget to include "jdom-2.0.5.jar", also in the "data" folder.
